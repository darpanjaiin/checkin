Additional Notes
Zero Coding Experience, Using Cursor.ai:

Rely heavily on generating boilerplate code for your chosen stack (React + Node.js + Express, for example).
After generating code, carefully review for correctness, security, and compliance with the rules set out above.
Use the system architecture and instructions to guide the prompts you give to cursor.ai (e.g., “Generate a React functional component for a guest check-in form with X fields, using Formik for form management and Yup for validation.”).
Best Practices:

Keep it simple: The MVP should focus on core features.
Ensure secure handling of user data: Identity proofs and contact details are sensitive.
