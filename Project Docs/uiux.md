5. UI/UX Design Docs
Below are high-level guidelines and sketches that follow best practices and the design principles you listed.

5.1 Visual Design & Branding
Color Palette

Choose a simple, calming palette, e.g., a primary color (blue/green) for call-to-action buttons, neutral backgrounds (white/light gray).
Maintain strong color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).
Typography

Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans).
Maintain consistent sizing with relative units (rem, em).
Layout

Mobile-first: Single-column layout for forms.
For desktop: Could display multiple guests in one view.
Keep a consistent grid system (CSS Flexbox or Grid).
5.2 Interaction Design & User Flows
5.2.1 Guest Self Check-In Flow
Landing Page → user sees a short description or brand logo → “Proceed to Check-In” button.
Check-In Form → users fill Name, Contact, Identity Proof Upload, Check-In/Out dates, Special Requests.
Additional Guests → a button “Add Another Guest” to dynamically add fields for more guests.
Confirmation Screen → user sees a summary of entered details and can confirm or go back to edit.
5.2.2 Host Dashboard Flow
Login → username/password → upon success, redirect to Dashboard.
Dashboard → a table listing all submissions with columns for name, contact, etc.
Export Button → allows CSV download.
(Optional) Detail View → click on a row to view full details, see document images, etc.
5.3 Accessibility
Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <form>, <label>).
Provide alt text for images.
Ensure keyboard navigability (tab order, focus indicators).
5.4 Performance Optimization
Lazy Loading: For large images or data sets.
Minification: JavaScript and CSS.
Code Splitting: For front-end bundles.
5.5 Testing and Iteration
Conduct usability tests with sample hosts/guests.
Use analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user interactions, completion rates.
Iterate on design improvements (A/B test form layout).
